# MilMove Documentation

![GitHub pages](https://github.com/transcom/mymove-docs/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml/badge.svg)

## Overview

This repo contains the documentation for [MilMove](https://github.com/transcom/mymove), a possible next generation version of the Defense Personal Property System (DPS). DPS is an online system managed by the U.S. [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) (DoD) [Transportation Command](http://www.ustranscom.mil/) (USTRANSCOM) and is used by service members and their families to manage household goods moves. 

Information about running and testing this app, and coding against its APIs, is located here. If you have questions or notice inaccuracies, feel to either (if you are on the project) edit the docs directly or (if you an external contractor) open an issue regarding the problem.

## Layout

- `/docs/` contains all of our documentation files (in markdown). If you are here to edit or peruse the docs, this is where you want to go.
- `/src/` contains our React components and pages. Currently, this only contains our main page. It will be rare to need to be in this folder.
- `/static/` contains all of our images and other static files. If you want to add a screenshot or other visual to your doc page, you will need to upload it to this folder.
- `/sidebars.js` contains the sidebars for our doc folders. We autogenerate our sidebars in order to minimize how often our JavaScript files will need to be updated. It is highly unlikely that you will need to update this file directly.

Testing. TESTING. **So much testing.** *Do I remember Markdown?* (James)
