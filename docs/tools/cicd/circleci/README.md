# CircleCI

## Overview
Developers use CircleCI to push builds to [deployed environments](https://dp3.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MT/pages/1467252884/Deployment). 
Developers create pull-requests via GitHub to request review of new/changed code. Once the review/feedback process is complete and approved,
the developer using GitHub to merges the code to the main branch of the code base.
The continuous integration tool, CircleCI, is used to run automated tests 
and [create and push builds](https://dp3.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MT/pages/1402306561/0051+-+Circle+CI+creating+build+artifacts) to deployed environments.
