# Okta

:::tip
You can find Okta Docs for developers here: **https://developer.okta.com/**

We will use Okta Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) solution for secure access to the MilMove website. Previously MilMove was using Login.gov for authentication, but it was discovered that Login.gov did not meet IAL2 services and so there was a need to switch to a more secure identity management service - enter <b>Okta</b>.

From the MilMove application, it will redirect all users to Okta when they click **Sign in**. This will prompt them to sign in (only customers can self register and have a **Sign up** button).There are two separate authentication policies for customers and office/admin users:

- **Customer**
    - Two factor authentication using any of the following:
        - Password
        - Email code
        - Okta Verify push notification
        - Okta Verify code
        - Google Authenticator
        - Smart Card authentication

:::info
The user ***MUST*** have their EDIPI/DoD ID# in their Okta profile in order to authenticate with their Smart Card.
:::
- **Back Office/Admin**
    - <i>ONLY</i> Smart Card authentication
        - NOTE: GSA users do not use CACs, they use PIVs which do not contain EDIPIs. This requires a little more configuration within the Okta Admin Console to pull the appropriate value to authenticate a user.<br/>
        <b>(THIS IS STILL IN PROGRESS)</b>

You can access the Okta consoles here if you are a set up as a customer or admin user: <br />
Okta console for <b>TESTING</b>: `https://test-milmove.okta.mil`<br/>
Okta console for <b>PRODUCTION</b>: `https://milmove.okta.mil`

You will need an Okta account with access to each respective application, which can be done within the Okta Admin Console by designated personnel. At this time, *office* and *admin* users will be created and activated using a **CSV file** that specifies which group they are in that will automatically assign them to the application they can access. Only specific personnel are able to import this CSV file and those imported users will be unable to edit their Okta profile since the account creation/activation are done in the Okta Admin Console.

:::info
Only customers can self register and update for an Okta account.
