# Documentation Vault

The vault is the place to store old, archived documentation that cannot yet be deleted and documentation that needs to be moved elsewhere. For example, some docs that were placed in the old `mymove` wiki truly belong in our Confluence instance. They have been moved into the vault for the interim. Once the issues with removing these docs has been resolved, they will typically be deleted.
