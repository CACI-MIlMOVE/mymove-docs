# DTOD

DTOD stands for Defense Table of Official Distances.

The official distances are provided by [Defense Table of Official Distances website](https://dtod.transport.mil/Default.aspx).

On MilMove, DTOD is used to calculate the distance between two zips. This affects things like incentive calculation.
